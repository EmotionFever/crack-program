# Crack program for Boonzi

Program that allows you to access premium features of a program called Boonzi. My program as a GUI where you only have to click a button for the program to start. 

### Simple Overview of how the crack was made

I opened Boonzi for the first time and, after searching in the whole files of the program, I found a '.swf' file that caught my attention due to its size. I searched for how to decompile a '.swf' file and I found JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler. I opened the '.swf' file of Boonzi and it decompiled smoothly on JPEXS. It decompiled to something very similar to assembly.  I searched in all the files and folders and after a lot of trial and error, I found  a handler that had a variable that after I activated it to true it cracked the program. After that I found a way to disable auto-updated on the app. Finally, I made a GUI for the app. And finished.
